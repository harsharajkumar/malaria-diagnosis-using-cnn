# Malaria Image Classification with TensorFlow CNN

This repository implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for classifying malaria parasites in images using TensorFlow and TensorFlow Datasets. The project provides a well-organized framework for data preparation, augmentation, model training, and evaluation.

Getting Started

Prerequisites:

Python 3.x
TensorFlow (https://www.tensorflow.org/)
TensorFlow Datasets (https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets)
NumPy (https://numpy.org/)
Matplotlib (https://matplotlib.org/)
Scikit-learn (https://scikit-learn.org/)
OpenCV (https://opencv.org/) (optional for custom augmentation)
Seaborn (https://seaborn.pydata.org/)
wandb (optional for experiment logging)

Project Structure:

malaria_classification.py: Main script for data preparation, model building, training, and evaluation (replace with your actual script name).
utils.py (optional): Utility functions for data preprocessing, visualization, etc. (if applicable).
requirements.txt: Lists project dependencies.
Data Preparation

TensorFlow Datasets is used to load the 'malaria' dataset (or adjust for your dataset name).
Data is split into training, validation, and testing sets.
Optional data visualization helps understand data distribution.
Data Augmentation (Optional)

Image augmentation techniques are explored to artificially increase dataset size and improve model generalization. Techniques include:
Adjusting saturation
Rotation
Horizontal flip
Random contrast
Consider exploring Mixup and CutMix (commented out in the code).
Model Building

The CNN architecture is defined using TensorFlow's tf.keras library (not shown in the provided code). It typically involves:
Convolutional layers for feature extraction
Pooling layers for dimensionality reduction
Fully connected layers for classification
Training (Replace with your Training Code)

The model is compiled with appropriate loss function, optimizer, and metrics.
Training is performed on the prepared training dataset with validation on the validation set.
Metrics like accuracy, loss, precision, recall, etc., are monitored.
Evaluation (Replace with your Evaluation Code)

The trained model's performance is evaluated on the unseen test dataset using the chosen metrics.
Customization

Feel free to customize the model architecture, hyperparameters (learning rate, epochs, etc.), and experiment with different augmentation techniques to optimize performance for your specific dataset.
Additional Notes

Consider including hyperparameter tuning techniques like GridSearchCV or RandomizedSearchCV to optimize model hyperparameters (optional).
Explore visualization techniques like confusion matrices or ROC curves to gain deeper insights into model performance (optional).
